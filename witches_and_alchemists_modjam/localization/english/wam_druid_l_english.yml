 trait_druid_desc:0 "Druids are commonly known as sorcerers with supernatural powers, particularly for their ability to perform the art of divination. Stories say they cast spells and turn people into animals or stones, or curse peoples' crops to be blighted. Often sought out as adjudicators, lorekeepers, healers, and political advisors, they are well respected in society. \n\nIn truth they are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but instead see themselves as extensions of it's indomitable will."
